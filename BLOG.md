# Introducing Waterly: Your Simple Water Intake Tracker ðŸ’§

Staying hydrated is essential for a healthy lifestyle, but with busy schedules, itâ€™s easy to forget to drink enough water throughout the day. Thatâ€™s why we built **Waterly**â€”a minimalist, intuitive web app to help you effortlessly track your daily water intake.

## Why Waterly?

Unlike complicated health apps, Waterly focuses on one thing: making it easy to record how much water you drink and motivating you to reach your daily hydration goal. No unnecessary features, no distractionsâ€”just hydration tracking made simple.

## Key Features

- **Set a Daily Goal:** The app starts you with a default goal of 2000ml, but you can customize the amount you want to drink each day.
- **Quick Add:** Record every glass or bottle in secondsâ€”just enter the amount and tap "Add".
- **Progress Bar:** Visualize your progress with a clear, dynamic progress bar that fills as you drink.
- **Reset Anytime:** Easily reset your daily count for a fresh start.

## How It Works

1. Enter the amount of water you drink in milliliters (e.g., 250ml).
2. Click "Add" and watch your progress grow.
3. Hit your daily goal and celebrate your consistency!

## Why Track Water Intake?

Proper hydration improves energy, focus, skin health, and overall well-being. Waterly makes it easy to build better hydration habits, one glass at a time.
